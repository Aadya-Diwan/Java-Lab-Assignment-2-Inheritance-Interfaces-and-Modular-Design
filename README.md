# Java-Lab-Assignment-2-Inheritance-Interfaces-and-Modular-Design  
Design and implement a Student Management System using inheritance, 
polymorphism, and interfaces. The system should consist of an abstract class 
Person with common fields such as name and email, and a concrete class Student 
that extends Person with additional fields like rollNo, course, marks, and grade. 
Implement an interface RecordActions with methods to add, delete, update, 
and view student records. Use a StudentManager class to handle the operations 
on student records, ensuring that duplicate roll numbers are prevented. The 
system should demonstrate method overriding, method overloading, and 
the use of abstract methods.
